## Design

Layout can be found here [Layout](./layout.png)

* `Navigation`, `Cards section` and `Metrics Section` in the layout are `config driven section`.
* `All the cards` in the cards section are retrieved using `single api call`.
* `Metrics` in the metrics section are retrieved using `seperate api call`. (eg. if metrics section has 3 metrics, 3 api calls are made.)
* `All the components` have their corresponding `skeletons html`. 
* `Nested navigation` is supported
* From the `Dashboard` page, can be redirected to other dashboards by `clicking` either on the `Card or Metric`.
* `localstorage` is included in all the pages with `seperate keys` to store the `filters`. When the page reloads the selected filters are applied. 

all the mock configuration and sample data can be found here [mocks](../mocks/)
